# RoadPulse AI
### Community-Driven Traffic & Road Infrastructure Intelligence

RoadPulse AI is an AI-powered platform that enables citizens to report road infrastructure issues such as potholes, waterlogging, accidents, blocked roads, and traffic signal failures. The system automatically analyzes uploaded images, classifies incidents, detects duplicate reports, assigns the appropriate government department, and stores reports for monitoring and analytics.

This project was built as an MVP for an Agentic AI Hackathon.

## Problem Statement

Road infrastructure issues often remain unreported or are reported through informal channels.

As a result:

- Delayed repairs
- Vehicle damage
- Traffic congestion
- Increased accident risk
- Lack of transparency

RoadPulse AI solves this by creating a community-driven reporting platform powered by AI.

# Why RoadPulse AI?

RoadPulse AI combines Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, GIS, and Community Reporting to create a smarter, safer, and more responsive road infrastructure management system.

Instead of simply collecting complaints, the platform analyzes, validates, prioritizes, and routes issues automatically, reducing manual effort and enabling faster action.
